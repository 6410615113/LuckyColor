"Today, beware of coping with stress in the workplace. You could get to the point where you won't be able to finish something before a deadline, which might increase the pressure on you.

"You feel a caring, compassionate, and nurturing vibe, which makes you want to help those in need.

Giving back to the community will improve your karma in the long run."
"It is a day to tie up loose ends. Clear the decks for new adventures and undertakings. Completing once you have started is the main thing, and you need to be decisive about the way you do it.

Let the day end with satisfaction."

You can manage the challenges and accomplish your objectives with the right mindset."
"While your productivity is important, do not forget that balance is crucial in keeping yourself healthy and productive.

"Acting now won't guarantee success, but it will mean you receive the loudest applause of all. Take that risk even if you haven't worked out all the possible consequences yet."
"Buddy up with someone you get along well with and let the ideas flow. Even if you ordinarily work best alone, you'll find your productivity jumping when you're harnessed to someone else."
"Everything is going well for you and your team, so now all you have to do is buckle down and go over the fine details thoroughly. Lead by example and others will follow."

"Conflict is not your specialty, and you may find yourself turning your back today on those who seem to revel in conflict. Do not try to understand why others do what they do or say what they say.

It's important to adequately relax your entire back. Yoga or a hot bath is in order."
"When someone as talented as you are gets stuck behind a desk, it's a crying shame. If you feel the creative artist inside kicking to be let out of the closet, open the door! By all means this world needs another Picasso, another Simone de Beauvoir. Why not investigate the offers at the local college and see if a future online class in your preferred field would fit your schedule? If you get pleasure from arranging flowers at home, then it's time to put flowers in the family budget!"
"There is a cure for feeling cranky and fed-up with people, but it's probably not something you'll want to hear if you feel this way! Take some time out and re-focus on yourself. Listen to your favorite music, cut some fresh flowers and put them in every room in the house. Freshen up your surroundings and then ask yourself: what is it that you are doing that is not working? Everyone gets lost once in a while. Breathe deeply and remember that every day is a chance to start over."

These recommendations could keep you out of trouble!"
"If your self-confidence is connected with approval from others, you may be in a cycle of dependence, and too much dependence on the reactions of others can lead to frustration. Of course, there is a fine line here, but err on the side of healthy self-esteem! Treating yourself well is the way to do this. Be vigilant about getting your exercise, eating healthy and delicious foods, and above all, getting your rest. If you have trouble sleeping, brew chamomile tea to help relax at bedtime."
